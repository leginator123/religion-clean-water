            <h2>The Global Water Crisis</h2>
            <p class="text-body">
                Water wasting has become a big issue and also with the recent spike of population,
                it was said to be hard to satisfy the needs of clean water for everyone... Until CWFE was founded.

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Why This Matters</h2>
            <p class="text-body">
                Everybody deserves to live and flourish and children shouldn't be thinking about providing water to the house,
                they should be thinking about their education and having a good childhood. Me having a childhood without the
                need of hunting for water and some people not having that luxury doesn't sit right with me.

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Who is Affected?</h2>
            <p class="text-body">
                High density and low resource / hot countries face the most issues. Also countries with diseases going around. e.g. India, Nigeria, Sudan to name a few.
